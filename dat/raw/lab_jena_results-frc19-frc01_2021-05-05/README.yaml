Contents:
  - density fractionation worksheet with mass data
Notes:
  - Density fractionation performed with an SPT solution at a density of 1.8 g cm^-3
  - Sonication for occluded light fraction conducted at 300 J ml^-1 equivalent
  - samples rinsed of SPT until conductivity dropped below 50 ÂµS
  - derived data files generated using the pivot table function on the data contained in 'Tabelle 1'
