Contents:
  - carbon and nitrogen content for remaining 2019 Sierra Nevada oPOM fraction soil samples (file 2 of 2)
Notes:
  - these were among the first samples processed, and we had initially opted to leave the oPOM sample on the paper filter; however this caused problems, so we ended up scraping off the material at a later date, hence the delay in the results
  - fractionated sample is a composite of the three spatially replicated profiles, by depth
  - added sheet "Pivot" to split C and N data into individual columns; this is necessary to match the template file for ingest
  - Sample names:
    - 2_GRrf_comp_2019_10-20_OPOM
