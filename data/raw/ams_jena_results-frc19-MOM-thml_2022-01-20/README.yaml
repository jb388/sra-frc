Contents:
  - 14C data from thermally fractionated heavy samples ANwf, BSwf, GRwf (20-30cm, 2019)
Notes:
  - 5 temperature cuts for each samples
  - Made temperature cuts based on thermograms, i.e. "peak fitting"
  - ANwf, GRwf thermally fractionated on 4 May 2021
  - BSwf thermally fractionated Feb. 2022; data sent via email (see below) and copied into Jena AMS template (file name = "BSwf_MOM_20-30_14c.xlsx")
  - email w/ BSwf data:
    - "Hey Jeff,

Sorry for not sending them along! Here's my lazy copy-paste.

I guess we probably can't meet this week... but maybe you could send me your code? I'd be curious to see how things are initialized and formatted.

Hope y'all are feeling okay! I guess we'll be around your house sometime later today.

Cheers,
Shane"
