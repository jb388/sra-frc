Contents:
  - C release data from thermally fractionated heavy samples ANwf and GRwf (20-30cm, 2019)
Notes:
  - 5 temperature cuts for each samples
  - Made temperature cuts based on thermograms, i.e. "peak fitting"
  - thermally fractionated on 4 May 2021

    "Hey Jeff,

    Here are those data. The standard smoothing procedures are already applied. I can also share the code for fitting a spline to fill in the temperature gaps for plotting etc. Let me know!

    Cheers,
    Shane"
